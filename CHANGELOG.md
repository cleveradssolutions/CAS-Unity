:warning: You will need to implement the flag irrespective of the use of mediation.  
```cs
CAS.ATTrackingStatus.Request((status) => {
  CAS.MobileAds.BuildManager()
    .WithMediationExtras(MediationExtras.facebookDataProcessing, "LDU_1_1000")
    .WithMediationExtras(MediationExtras.facebookAdvertiserTracking, track ? "1" : "0")
    .Initialize();
});
```
- [Android] With Android 12 many mediation partners are starting to include the `com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID` permission.  
:warning: Use new `Remove permission to use Advertising ID` option in `Android Settings` window to remove the permission for all manifests.  
Also, some mediation partners are already working with a new `App set ID` that you can add to your game in the `Android Settings > Advanced Integration` section.
### Banner Ads update
- Improved calculation of the `AdSize.AdaptiveBanner`.
- We had to rethink the structure of banners and banner sizes to make their work clearer and more efficient.
- Each a `AdSize` has its own unique ad view. ~~Single `AdSize` instance for `IMediationManager`~~.
- Added a new `IAdView` interface to manage the single `AdSize` instance.
```cs
IMediationManager manager = MobileAds.BuildManager().Initialize();
IAdView adView = manager.GetAdView( AdSize.MediumRectangle );
```
- Separated the `AdSize.MediumRectangle` from `AdFlags.Banner` format to new `AdFlags.MediumRectangle` format to better configuration of the mediation manager.
